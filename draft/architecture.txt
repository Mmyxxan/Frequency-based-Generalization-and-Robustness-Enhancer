Pytorch classes: in generic.py or generic folder
Model class + build_model function, 
    init
    forward
    save_checkpoint
    load_checkpoint
Dataset class (load from HuggingFace, from data root dir), build_dataset function, 
Dataloader class, build_data_loader function
Transform class to build transform from config and to be passed into Dataset class,
    Available data augmentations, note required format of dataset, input data and output data
Trainer class, different types of training from config,
Evaluator class, different evaluation metrics from config, evaluate on different subsets, 
Config class,
    model
    dataset
    trainer
    evaluator
main.py: parse args to build_config

Utils class (before-train utils and after-train utils),
    inspect dataset, 
    visualization, 
    parse results and turn into tables

build both Pytorch and Tensorflow versions
